A device that can measure the passage of Time.

What It Is
----------

It is an ARM-based wrist watch using the Arduion/Teensy3.0 platform. 
It has an integreated RTC, 18+hours of battery life, and USB support to set the time.
I made it over the course of 2 weeks during the 2013 Austin Peay Govornor's School for Computational Physics.
